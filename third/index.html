           <p>Considering hiding the status bar -- and all other app UI --
            while people are actively viewing full-screen media. If you hide the status bar,
            be sure to let people retrieve it ( and the appropriate app UI ) with a single tap.
            Unless you have a compelling reason to do so, avoid defining a custom  gesture to
            redisplay the status bar because users are unlikely to discover such a gesture or to
            remember it.
